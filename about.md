Hello! My name is Aman Jilani. I'm a Molecular Genetics graduate out of the University of Dundee.
In this blog I write about Plants, Space, Meterology and General Science! Sometimes I may also include articles about other
areas that interest me.

Thank you for vising my blog, and I hope you enjoy :)
